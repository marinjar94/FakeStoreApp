# Fake Store App

This is an app where we are handling an App for a Fake Store, using the following API URL https://fakestoreapi.com/ . We are going to be handling credentials, and also showing a list of products. Handling success and error in both situations

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```


3. Check the app!


Use Expo Go (Android App or iOS App), or directly on web (http://localhost:8081). In both cases, make sure to be in the same wifi.



Optional. In case of problems with cache, use -c flag

   ```bash
    npx expo start -c
   ```

Fake Login Details are as of follow **USERNAME= "mor_2314" password = "83r5^_"** . Use these fake credentials to test App.


Important: Need to download "Expo Go" in order to easily see App without having to have iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
